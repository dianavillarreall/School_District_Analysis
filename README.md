# School_District_Analysis
Performing analysis on all schools from a school distric utilizing Jupyter books
## Overview of the school district analysis

### Purpose
This analysis was created for the school board since they have been notified that there has been academic dishonesty at the Thomas High School 9th grade. The analysis shows the results of testing after removing the group blamed for academic dishonesty.

## Results

### How is the district summary affected?
The district summary was barely affected if at all with none of the averages having a significant change or percentages lowering more than 0.31%
### How is the school summary affected?
Since it's a smaller data sample it was expected for the school summary to be significantly more affected when it comes to the percentages compared to the district summary, it lowered 27% in math, 28% in reading and 25% in overall passing rate  
### How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
After replacing the ninth graders scores you can see a clear fall in the Thomas High School's performance as before the changes they were ranked as the 2nd high school with the best overall passing rate and now they rank as the 8th out of 15 schools.
### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following: 
* Math and reading scores by grade
It did not affect the math and reading scores 
* Scores by school spending
There wasn't a significant difference in the spending after replacing the ninth-grade scores
* Scores by school size
The most significant change was in the percentage passing reading and overall passing percentage of 0.06%
* Scores by school type
With Thomas High School being a Charter school there was only a difference of 0.01% in the math passing percentage, and 0.04% in both passing reading percentage and overall passing percentage

## Summary
After analysing all this data we can conclude that the school summary was the most affected by the changes lowering their overall passing rate by 25% compared to the district summary wich was barely affected at all. We can also see a clear fall in the school rank after removing the ninth grade lowering their status by 6 places in the whole district while most of the scores did not have a significant change. This proves us that if this class was really commmiting academic dishonesty it was good to create this analysis since you can see the real ranking of the schools
